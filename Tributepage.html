    Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer,chiefly known for her work on Charles's Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer,the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and created the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result,she is often regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.
